#Project Documentation: Email Scheduling and Throttling
This project allows you to schedule and throttle emails using Elastic Email as the Email Service Provider (ESP). Below are the instructions for setting up the project, configuring API keys, and managing email scheduling and throttling.

Setup and Configuration Instructions
1. Obtain API Key from Elastic Email
To use Elastic Email's service for sending emails programmatically, you need to obtain an API key.

Steps to get the API key:
Go to the Elastic Email website.
Log in to your account, or sign up if you don’t have an account.
Once logged in, go to Account > API Keys in the dashboard.
Create a new API key by clicking Add API Key. You can give it a name and set the required permissions (read, write, etc.).
Copy the generated API key for use in the project.
2. Configure Elastic Email API Key in Your Project
To integrate Elastic Email API into your project, follow these steps:

Step 1: Create a .env file in your project directory (if it does not already exist).

Step 2: Add the following environment variable to the .env file:

makefile
Copy code
ELASTIC_EMAIL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Replace your_api_key_here with the API key you obtained from Elastic Email.

Step 3: Use a library like requests or elasticemail (Python SDK) to make API calls to send emails programmatically.

Example of using the requests library to send an email:

python
Copy code
import requests
import os

# Fetch API key from environment variable
api_key = os.getenv("ELASTIC_EMAIL_API_KEY")

def send_email(subject, body, to_email):
    url = "https://api.elasticemail.com/v4/emails"
    data = {
        'apikey': api_key,
        'from': 'your_email@example.com',
        'to': to_email,
        'subject': subject,
        'bodyHtml': body
    }
    response = requests.post(url, data=data)
    return response.json()

# Example usage
response = send_email('Test Subject', 'Test Body', 'recipient@example.com')
print(response)
3. Install Required Dependencies
Install any required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests
Steps to Configure Email Scheduling and Throttling
Email Scheduling
Elastic Email does not directly offer scheduling features via the API, but you can handle this functionality by using Python’s scheduling libraries like APScheduler or schedule to delay or run email sending tasks at specific intervals.

Example of Email Scheduling using APScheduler:
Install APScheduler:

bash
Copy code
pip install apscheduler
Code to schedule the sending of emails:

python
Copy code
from apscheduler.schedulers.blocking import BlockingScheduler
from datetime import datetime

scheduler = BlockingScheduler()

def send_scheduled_email():
    subject = "Scheduled Email"
    body = "This is a scheduled email."
    to_email = "recipient@example.com"
    send_email(subject, body, to_email)
    print(f"Email sent at {datetime.now()}")

# Schedule the email to send at a specific time (e.g., 10:30 AM every day)
scheduler.add_job(send_scheduled_email, 'interval', hours=24, start_date='2024-11-10 10:30:00')
scheduler.start()
In this example, the email will be sent every 24 hours starting at 10:30 AM on November 10, 2024.

Email Throttling
Elastic Email allows you to manage email sending rate using throttling by controlling the interval between email sends. You can implement throttling manually in your script using Python’s time.sleep() function.

Example of Email Throttling:
python
Copy code
import time

def send_email_with_throttling(subject, body, to_email, throttle_interval=60):
    # Send the email
    send_email(subject, body, to_email)
    print(f"Email sent to {to_email}")
    
    # Throttle the sending of emails by waiting for a specified time (in seconds)
    time.sleep(throttle_interval)  # e.g., wait 60 seconds before sending the next email

# Example usage with throttling:
send_email_with_throttling('Test Subject', 'Test Body', 'recipient1@example.com', throttle_interval=60)
send_email_with_throttling('Test Subject', 'Test Body', 'recipient2@example.com', throttle_interval=60)
In this example, emails will be sent with a 60-second interval between them, helping to avoid hitting Elastic Email’s rate limits.

Usage Instructions
Configure the .env File:

Create a .env file in the project directory.
Add your Elastic Email API key as shown in the configuration section.
Schedule Emails:

Use the APScheduler or schedule library to schedule emails at the desired intervals.
Modify the scheduling code to match your use case (e.g., specific times, dates, or recurring schedules).
Throttle Email Sends:

Use the time.sleep() function to implement throttling and avoid exceeding Elastic Email’s rate limits.
Run the Script:

Once configured, run the Python script to start sending emails according to the schedule and throttle settings.
Monitor:

You can check the Elastic Email dashboard to monitor email sends and track the success or failure of each email.
