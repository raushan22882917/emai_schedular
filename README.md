# Email Scheduling and Throttling System

## Overview
This project enables automated email sending with scheduling and throttling capabilities using an Email Service Provider (ESP). The system allows for the configuration of API keys, email scheduling, and throttling to avoid exceeding the ESP's rate limits. It provides an easy-to-use interface to send emails at specified times, while also ensuring that you don't exceed the sending rate limits imposed by your ESP.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up this project, ensure that you have the following:

- Python 3.x or above
- An active Email Service Provider (ESP) account (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, or similar)
- Access to a terminal/command line interface

### Required Python Packages:
1. `requests` - For making HTTP requests to the ESP API.
2. `schedule` - For scheduling email tasks.
3. `time` - For handling timing and delays in the system.

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install requests schedule python-dotenv


## Setup and Configuration

### Obtaining API Keys
1. **Create an account** with your chosen ESP (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.).
2. Navigate to the **API settings** section of your ESP's dashboard to generate an **API key**.
   - **For SendGrid**: Visit [SendGrid API Key Generation](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys).
   - **For Mailgun**: Visit [Mailgun API Key Generation](https://app.mailgun.com/app/account/security).
3. Copy the **generated API key** to use in the configuration step.

### Configuring API Keys
1. Create a `.env` file in the project directory (if it doesn't already exist).
2. Add your ESP API key to this file using the following format:
   ```env
   ESP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Ensure the `.env` file is added to `.gitignore` to keep your API key secure.

4. Load the `.env` file in your Python code:

   ```python
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   import os

   load_dotenv()

   ESP_API_KEY = os.getenv('ESP_API_KEY')
   ```

## Email Scheduling and Throttling

### Scheduling Emails
To schedule an email, specify the recipient, subject, body, and send time. Use the `schedule` library to define when the email will be sent.

Example code to schedule an email:

```python
import schedule
import time
from datetime import datetime
import send_email_function  # Import the function to send emails

# Function to send email
def send_email():
    recipient = "recipient@example.com"
    subject = "Test Email"
    body = "This is a test email."
    send_email_function.send_email_via_ESP(recipient, subject, body)

# Schedule the email to be sent at a specific time
schedule_time = "2024-11-09 10:00:00"  # Example: set the date and time
schedule.every().day.at(schedule_time).do(send_email)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(1)
```

You can replace `send_email_function.send_email_via_ESP()` with your actual ESP API call logic.

### Configuring Throttling
To configure throttling, set a maximum number of emails to be sent per minute to avoid hitting ESP rate limits.

Example code for throttling:

```python
import time
import send_email_function  # Import the function to send emails

MAX_EMAILS_PER_MINUTE = 5
EMAIL_DELAY = 60 / MAX_EMAILS_PER_MINUTE  # Delay between emails to throttle the rate

def send_email_throttled():
    # Your email sending logic here
    send_email_function.send_email_via_ESP()

# Send emails with throttling
for i in range(10):  # Example: Send 10 emails
    send_email_throttled()
    time.sleep(EMAIL_DELAY)
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Set up the environment** by following the configuration steps mentioned earlier.
2. **Configure email scheduling** using the `schedule` library to specify when emails should be sent.
3. **Apply throttling** to ensure the number of emails sent per minute doesn't exceed the limit imposed by your ESP.
4. **Run the script** to start the scheduling process.

To run the scheduling script:

This will continuously check for scheduled emails and send them at the specified times with the configured throttling.
